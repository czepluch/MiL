\subsection{Market forces}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Party people}\\
	financially speaking, this is the most important segment that Musik i Lejet has. Sales of food and beverages made at the nightly after parties greatly exceeds what is sold at the rest of the festival (ref interview med Kristian og Stakke). The segment is attractive because of their willingness to spend money at the festival, but securing the segment may conflict with appealing to other segments such as families and elderly. The segment demands an offer contemporary, hyped party music, and low prices on and decent selection of alcoholic beverages.(reference til kristian og stakke)
	\item \textbf{Music enthusiasts}\\
	This segment is attractive because of their loyalty towards specific genres or bands. Its this segment that buys their ticket in advance, which contributes to financial stability for the festival (ref kristian og stakke). They demand an interesting and contemporary offer of live musical acts. This segment may be further broken down into segments of music enthusiasts within separate musical genres. One of the challenges of securing this segment is evaluating the trade-offs of weighting one genre over another in the booked acts.
	\item \textbf{Sponsors}\\
	The attractiveness of sponsors is that their presence reduces economic risk taken on by Musik i Lejet. They need festivals that will strengthen their own brand by association.
