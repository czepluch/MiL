-ideer til problemformulering\\
Stine: "MiL er vokset, det er nødvendigt at at der er nogen der får ansvaret for specifikke arbejdsopgaver for at det overhovedet kan lade sig gøre at afvikle festivalen."\\
+ Stine: "Problem når folk forlader organisationen, fordi der forsvinder meget viden."\\

Andreas + Stakke: "Festivalen er blevet større og hver person i bestyrelsen havde rigtig meget ansvar og meget viden, men dette ansvar og viden var ikke delt."\\

Andreas + Stakke: "Men der er ingen tvivl om, at vi skal gøre noget aktivt for at fremme kommunikationen mellem teamlederne for at undgå at alt vendes med os i bestyrelsen."\\

+ Andreas + Stakke: "Derudover skal vi blive bedre til at bruge Podio, som er vores kommunikationsmedie.\\"

Problemformulering:\\


\section{Organizational setup, key players and KPI's}
At this point of the project we identified a number of KPI's, during our observations and interviews and we will use this section to underline some of the aspects according to these.
In appendix xx a summary of an interview with Stine F is being described and she talks about some of her concerns about the price of a ticket to the festival. She believes that \\
KPI:\\
-Billetpris/økonomisk stabilitet\\
-Teams skal overholde deres budget
- 24 timers regel på podio
\section{Current work practices}
This section will describe some of the work there is, when working in the planning group of Mil. Before going in to the actual descriptions, we do however need to mention, that observing work practices in an organization as this, is not a trivial task. We have observed the work practices in the form of interviews and an observation at the General Assembly, which hardly can be formulated as actual practices, but more as a mean to work. However, we have found several things, which we believe can be used as documentation for the practices. \\
At the General Assembly a suggestion from the board was raised, about all members being charged a fee for being part of MiL. The board explained that this was more a matter of regulation of a union, and to get some financial advantages, than a need for payment. The non-board(?) members raised some concerns regarding this issue, as stated in appendix xx. Surprisingly, even though the non-board members raised strongly concerns, the board decided to proceed with the suggestion, without a voting about it. \\
The board also included a short presentation of Podio at the General Assembly. As stated in appendix xx the board wants to have all internal communication in the planning group at Podio. This was clearly a new tool for some of the leaders, which was stated in the form of different questions(kilde?). Most of the presentation was about the different subpages at Podio and how to create things like events and tasks. This gave some insight what Podio is cable of, but no introduction was given about when a task was done nor when a task should be created for another member (better examples?).\\

During the interview with Stine F the project group made her participate in a 'process'-game. Here the interviewers asked her to explain the task of booking volunteers for the festival. The result of this game can be seen in appendix xx. In our opinion it clearly shows that a lot can be done in termns of deadlines for bookings of volunteers and also the way its done.

- Stemning og struktur på General Forsamling (blandt andet forslag om kontigent blev ikke besluttet)\\
- Podio (manglende af done og done-done) og noget andet?\\
- Problem med høj overpris af hegn\\
- Beskrivelse af process spil

\section{Goals, problems and needs}

\section{Ideas for solutions}
Podio workshop\\
Udvikling af program til at lave tasks og dependencies\\
Tutorial til podio (Tutorial til Podio lavet i Podio, så man skal bruge Podios funktionaliteter til at løse opgaver)\\
Vidensdeling?(Kunne være implementering af en app i Podio der 'automatisk' smider ting i en wiki eller lignende)\\
Good indexering af viden og færdiggjorte opgaver\\
Fastsættelse af done og done done (Indhente minimum 3 seriøst tilbud på større beslutninger og så i fælleskab beslutte, hvad der er bedst. Derefter underskrive kontrakt
og først der er opgaven done done)
