\section{Organizational setup, key players and KPI's}
At this point of the project we identified a number of KPI's, during our observations and interviews and we will use this section to underline some of the aspects according to these.
In appendix xx a summary of an interview with Stine F is being described and she talks about some of her concerns about the price of a ticket to the festival. She believes that \\
KPI:\\
-Billetpris/økonomisk stabilitet\\
-Teams skal overholde deres budget
- 24 timers regel på podio

This section will describe some of the work there is, when working in the planning group of Mil. Before going in to the actual descriptions, we do however need to mention, that observing work practices in an organization as this, is not a trivial task. We have observed the work practices in the form of interviews and an observation at the General Assembly, which hardly can be formulated as actual practices, but more as a mean to work. However, we have found several things, which we believe can be used as documentation for the practices. \\
At the General Assembly a suggestion from the board was raised, about all members being charged a fee for being part of MiL. The board explained that this was more a matter of regulation of a union, and to get some financial advantages, than a need for payment. The non-board(?) members raised some concerns regarding this issue, as stated in appendix xx. Surprisingly, even though the non-board members raised strongly concerns, the board decided to proceed with the suggestion, without a vote.

\section{Goals, problems and needs}

\section{Ideas for solutions}{ideas}
Podio workshop\\
Udvikling af program til at lave tasks og dependencies\\
Tutorial til podio (Tutorial til Podio lavet i Podio, så man skal bruge Podios funktionaliteter til at løse opgaver)\\
Vidensdeling?(Kunne være implementering af en app i Podio der 'automatisk' smider ting i en wiki eller lignende)\\
Good indexering af viden og færdiggjorte opgaver\\
Fastsættelse af done og done done (Indhente minimum 3 seriøst tilbud på større beslutninger og så i fælleskab beslutte, hvad der er bedst. Derefter underskrive kontrakt
og først der er opgaven done done)
