\part{In-depth Analysis}

\section{Organizational setup, key players and KPI's}
At this point of the project we identified a number of KPI's, during our observations and interviews and we will use this section to underline some of the aspects according to these.
In appendix xx a summary of an interview with Stine F is being described and she talks about some of her concerns about the price of a ticket to the festival. She believes that \\
KPI:\\
-Billetpris/økonomisk stabilitet\\
-Teams skal overholde deres budget
- 24 timers regel på podio
\section{Current work practices}
This section will describe some of the work there is, when working in the planning group of Mil. Before going in to the actual descriptions, we do however need to mention, that observing work practices in an organization as this, is not a trivial task. We have observed the work practices in the form of interviews and an observation at the General Assembly, which hardly can be formulated as actual practices, but more as a mean to work. However, we have found several things, which we believe can be used as documentation for the practices. \\
At the General Assembly a suggestion from the board was raised, about all members being charged a fee for being part of MiL. The board explained that this was more a matter of regulation of a union, and to get some financial advantages, than a need for payment. The non-board(?) members raised some concerns regarding this issue, as stated in appendix xx. Surprisingly, even though the non-board members raised strongly concerns, the board decided to proceed with the suggestion, without a voting about it. \\
The board also included a short presentation of Podio at the General Assembly. As stated in appendix xx the board wants to have all internal communication in the planning group at podio. This was clearly a new tool for some of the leaders, which was stated in the form of different questions(kilde?). Most of the presentation was about the different subpages at Podio and how to create things like events and tasks. This gave some insight what Podio is cable of, but no introduction was given about when a task was done nor when a task should be created for another member (better examples?). \\
 
- Stemning og struktur på General Forsamling (blandt andet forslag om kontigent blev ikke besluttet)\\
- Podio (manglende af done og done-done) og noget andet?\\
- Problem med høj overpris af hegn\\
- Beskrivelse af process spil

\section{Goals, problems and needs}


\section{Ideas for solutions}
In this section we will discuss some of the ideas we have for technical
solutions to help ease the organisational restructuring of \mil.
\subsection{Podio workshop}
It has come to our attention when attending \ref{General Assembly Appendix} that
a lot of the volunteers have very little knowledge of how Podio works. Due to
this one of our suggestions is to make a Podio workshop that teaches the basics
of Podio with the way \mil uses it in mind.
\\
\\
In addition to this, a tutorial made in Podio that uses the features of Podio to
teach how Podio works, is also an interesting solution.

Udvikling af program til at lave tasks og dependencies\\
Tutorial til podio (Tutorial til Podio lavet i Podio, så man skal bruge Podios funktionaliteter til at løse opgaver)\\
Vidensdeling?(Kunne være implementering af en app i Podio der 'automatisk' smider ting i en wiki eller lignende)\\
Good indexering af viden og færdiggjorte opgaver\\
Fastsættelse af done og done done (Indhente minimum 3 seriøst tilbud på større beslutninger og så i fælleskab beslutte, hvad der er bedst. Derefter underskrive kontrakt
og først der er opgaven done done)
