\part{In-line Analysis}

\section{Business Strategy}
The main objective of Musik i Lejet is to provide a cultural offer in the local community of Tisvildeleje, both as an offer to the local populous, and also to attract business to the community. This is achieved by a non-profit, cost driven business model, that relies heavily on volunteer work, grant money and private sponsorship. Cultural and economic value is generated by offering musical entertainment for a variety of customer segments, such as music enthusiasts, families with children and customers interested in attending parties.
\\ \\
Keeping a well defined and contemporary musical profile is essential for Musik i Lejet to fulfill both its cultural objectives, and to make the festival competitive with other festivals of the same size, addressing the same customer segments. Moreover, diversity within the festivals audience is of huge importance to Musik i Lejet. This is in part achieved by offering a wide selection of music in many different genres, but also by keeping ticket prices low, and providing free admission for children and the elderly.
\\ \\
The main challenges for Musik i Lejet include maintaining relationships with and interest from sponsors and cultural foundations, securing the necessary number of volunteer workers, coordinating the efforts of the 20-30 people who, without a physical and centralized work space, arrange the festival in their spare time, and obtaining contracts with contemporary and popular performing artists to an affordable price.

\section{Environment}
The industry of danish music festivals is a growing market attracting more people each year and has shown indications of a trend towards increased appreciation of larger live events. These different festivals differentiate significantly in vision, identity, and as mentioned, size. This means that when considering the market, competition does not exist on a higher level between all organisations of the market, but rather “locally” between festivals that seek to target the same customer segments. With this in notion music festivals also have a significant historical aspect as of which events range over a great deal of lifespans, some beyond decades, some newborn. With experience as a product to age, the ability to adapt becomes a value for the individual events. 

\bigskip

With a ticket price of 400 kr. for 3 full days of music and the distinct music profile, direct competing festival alternatives are significantly few in numbers, suggesting events such as trailerpark festival, or spot festival. MiL, being a relatively young music event, having an impressive amount success, might then not seem to points towards threats in external factors, such as competition or market issues, but rather internal challenges in relation to the increasing size of the organisation (customers, budget, and expectations). 

\bigskip

/*
The range of festivals of the market spans over a wide range of types of events, from heavy rock festivals like Copenhell(link) with a guest count of 11.000, to the multigenre Roskilde festival with a size of 100.000 guests(link).

\section{Work Domains}
\label{sec:work_domains}
This section describes the large scale work domains of MiL, and how they relate to each other.
\subsection{The board}
\label{sub:the_board}
The main responsibility of the board is to make strategic decisions of the festival. Arranger teams depend on these decisions for performing their tasks, as strategic decisions include e.g decisions on opening hours, beginning and end of music program. Thus, these strategic decisions can be described as constituting the framework in which the arranger teams work. The board is also responsible creating the overall budget of the festival, which defines the limits of the budget for each of the arranger teams. A board member may also be part of one or more arranger teams as either an arranger or team leader.

\subsection{Arranger teams} % (fold)
\label{sub:arranger_team}
An arranger team holds the responsibility for one coherent area of work in MiL as described in Appendix (ref til organisations diagram). A team consist of a team leader, and possibly a number of arrangers. Some teams consist only of the team leader.

\subsection{The team leaders}
\label{sub:team_leaders}
A team leader is the head of an arranger team. The team leader is responsible for communicating and coordinating with other teams who's work the team is dependent on or who is dependent on the work of the team lead by the team leader. Team leaders are also responsible for communicating with the board about the status of the team's work and whether or not the team is on budget. Team leaders from all arranger teams meet every 6 weeks, where leaders can update each other on the status of tasks, and coordinate tasks that are dependent on each other across teams.

\subsection{Arrangers}
\label{sub:team_members}
An arranger works within an arranger team. Arrangers and team leaders in cooperation delegate responsibility of subtasks within the team.
