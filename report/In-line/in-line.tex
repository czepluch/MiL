\part{In-line Analysis}

\section{Business Strategy}
The main objective of Musik i Lejet is to provide a cultural offer in the local community of Tisvildeleje, both as an offer to the local populous, and also to attract business to the community. This is achieved by a non-profit, cost driven business model, that relies heavily on volunteer work, grant money and private sponsorship. Cultural and economic value is generated by offering musical entertainment for a variety of customer segments, such as music enthusiasts, families with children and customers interested in attending parties.
\\ \\
Keeping a well defined and contemporary musical profile is essential for Musik i Lejet to fulfill both its cultural objectives, and to make the festival competitive with other festivals of the same size, addressing the same customer segments. Moreover, diversity within the festivals audience is of huge importance to Musik i Lejet. This is in part achieved by offering a wide selection of music in many different genres, but also by keeping ticket prices low, and providing free admission for children and the elderly.
\\ \\
The main challenges for Musik i Lejet include maintaining relationships with and interest from sponsors and cultural foundations, securing the necessary number of volunteer workers, coordinating the efforts of the 20-30 people who, without a physical and centralized work space, arrange the festival in their spare time, and obtaining contracts with contemporary and popular performing artists to an affordable price.

\section{Environment}
When studying MiL it is of importance to view it in the relative perspective of its surroundings to be able to determine strengths/weaknesses as well as relations, ultimately to support potential solutions. In this case we deal with the remaining forces of danish music festivals.
\\  \\
The industry of danish music festivals is a healthy and growing market showing indications of trends towards an increasing appreciation of larger live events. Many festivals exists as of today, but differentiate significantly in vision, identity, and size. This means that when considering the market, competition to MiL can not be inferred if they do not target the same customer segments. Due to MiLs price and target segments, opposing threats are few in numbers, e.g. Wonderfestiwall and trailerpark festival. This compitition fails to compete with MiL by due to the significent difference in ticket price.
\\  \\
Stable relationships with providers and stakeholders are of big part of what makes MiL possible, and are therefore an important aspect to maintain and care. Due to success throughout MiLs past years of events can provide stability as an organisation through factors such as: sold out events, positive publicity and continous increase in revenue. With this MiL has established quality cooperation agreements providing security and avoiding risk at depencies.
\\  \\
A potential risk occuring as a product of MiLs increasing success is the organisations capability of scaling its internal resources to match a larger event while maintaining the same value offer - This in view of the environment MiL lacks experience due to its relative young age. Failing to being able to cope with expansion could result in increased ticket prices. This would remove MiLs advantage, enabling competition to become competition


\section{Work Domains}
\label{sec:work_domains}
This section describes the large scale work domains of MiL, and how they relate to each other.
\subsection{The board}
\label{sub:the_board}
The main responsibility of the board is to make strategic decisions of the festival. Arranger teams depend on these decisions for performing their tasks, as strategic decisions include e.g decisions on opening hours, beginning and end of music program. Thus, these strategic decisions can be described as constituting the framework in which the arranger teams work. The board is also responsible creating the overall budget of the festival, which defines the limits of the budget for each of the arranger teams. A board member may also be part of one or more arranger teams as either an arranger or team leader.

\subsection{Arranger teams} % (fold)
\label{sub:arranger_team}
An arranger team holds the responsibility for one coherent area of work in MiL as described in Appendix (ref til organisations diagram). A team consist of a team leader, and possibly a number of arrangers. Some teams consist only of the team leader.

\subsection{The team leaders}
\label{sub:team_leaders}
A team leader is the head of an arranger team. The team leader is responsible for communicating and coordinating with other teams who's work the team is dependent on or who is dependent on the work of the team lead by the team leader. Team leaders are also responsible for communicating with the board about the status of the team's work and whether or not the team is on budget. Team leaders from all arranger teams meet every 6 weeks, where leaders can update each other on the status of tasks, and coordinate tasks that are dependent on each other across teams.

\subsection{Arrangers}
\label{sub:team_members}
An arranger works within an arranger team. Arrangers and team leaders in cooperation delegate responsibility of subtasks within the team.
