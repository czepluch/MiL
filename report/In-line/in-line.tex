\section{Business Strategy}
The main objective of Musik i Lejet is to provide a cultural offer in the local community of Tisvildeleje, both as an offer to the local populous, and also to attract business to the community. This is achieved by a non-profit business model, that relies heavily on volunteer work, grant money and private sponsorship. Cultural and economic value is generated by offering musical entertainment for a variety of customer segments, such as music enthusiasts, families with children and customers interested in attending wild parties. Keeping a well defined and contemporary musical profile is essential for Musik i Lejet to fulfill both its cultural objectives, and to make the festival competitive with other festivals of the same size, addressing the same customer segments. The main challenges for Musik i Lejet include maintaining relationships with and interest from sponsors and cultural foundations, securing the necessary number of volunteer workers, coordinating the efforts of the 20-30 people who, without a physical and centralized work space, arrange the festival in their spare time, and obtaining contracts with contemporary and popular performing artists to an affordable price.
