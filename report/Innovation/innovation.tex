\part{Innovation}
As the previous sections of the \texttt{In-depth phase} in part \ref{prt:in_depth_analysis},
especially in section \ref{sub:goprne}, has shown,
the organisation has room for optimisation and improvements. Based on the \ref{sub:ideas} that we
have developed and the fact that the organisation wants to continue using Podio, we have chosen two that we believe will bring the most benefits to the organisation.
We will in the following analyse both the solutions, and try to determine which will be the best or
if a third solution will emerge from this analysis. A short description of the ideas in focus
follows:


1. Work processes for Podio\\
In the previous the Diagnostic Map in section xx revealed several problem and related causes found in the organization. In 5b its said that the cause of this problem, is that their is too much off topic discussion and also that no real difference between pure informational topics and topics for discussions are in place within the organizational use of Podio. As Stine F also points out in 1a, the organization faces a problem about sharing of knowledge, since this is not documented properly on Podio.\\

This solution proposal will attempt to structure work processes when using Podio and make guidelines for the information posted at Podio. This proposal will therefore be directed at the use of Podio, with respect to the mentioned things in the above, and will keep to the organizations strategy about using Podio as their primary IT solution. 

2. Podio App
This solution consists of the development of a Podio application \footnote{https://developers.podio.com/doc/app-store}.
The application will be used to create, store, and visualise tasks in- and externally in the teams.
Thus, hopefully, making it very transparent which tasks are due to when.\\

\section{Work Process}

\subsection{Vision for overall change} 
This presented solution is a minimalistic approach, designed to extend the current work flow of the arrangers. The goal of its purpose is to introduce procedures to keep the communication flow of Podio occuring in the daily operations clean. With the current usage of product Podio, it takes advantage of users existing level of knowledge to the platform, by not introducing new artifacts but merely moving and defining domains and corresponding procedures. Specifically this solution seeks to introduce the following ideas:

\begin{itemize}
    \item An informel podio-space for unrelated communication between all MiL members. Topics unrelated to the planning of MiL are posted to this space to keep important information or decisions visable in the remaining workspaces.
    \item Guidelines for domains:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Questions or information of significance to organising MiL are posted their appropriate workspace. This means a status regarding booking of urinals should be posted the festival-area space, while general information such as a new booked musical act are posted to the employe space. Remaining content such as music acts on other festivals are refered to the previously mentioned "informel space".
        \item Questions with expected results, e.g. non-discussional, should not be posted as posts but created as a podio task with a specified deadline. 
        \item All meetings are documented through the podio calendar app. They are created on beforehand with its agenda and updated with a minute containing the matters discussed at the meeting, this includes discussions and agreed upon decisions.
        \item Ad-hoc decisions concluded through are added to the next occuring meetings agenda. This insures that information doesn't disappear or is bound to a single members, unobtainable from others.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Appointed moderators to maintain the content of the workspaces to ensure that the specified guidelines are met.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Technology}
The solution is based on the existing webapplication Podio. Though having extensive access to customizable apps and library settings, this solution takes use of the standard utilities that are already being used by MiL. Overall this solution maintains the level of complexitiy by avoiding adding new artifacts to the work domain.

\subsubsection{User interfaces}
As the solution is solely based on the podio platform, being a web solution, the interaction remains to the browser of a computer.

\subsection{Work organization}
As a result to the solution remaining within the current domain of used technologies the real introduction of change appears in the work practices of members of MiL. Arrangers and teamleaders will be forced to adjust there work rutines in compliance to the previously stated guidelines, effectively inflicting their work flow. 
This specifically means that arrangers and teamleaders must take active actions to create tasks, and be aware of where content is posted while newly appointed moderators will hafto take additional responsibility of maintaining the content podio spaces.

The must effective way this solution can be implemented in the organization will be as a pilot project, where selected members of the organization will be trained in how to use the formal ... 

\section{Podio extension}
\subsection{Visions for change}
\label{visions_for_change}
This solution is at its a heart in interactive visualization of tasks and task dependencies across arranger teams. Tasks are communicated between arranger teams with the already present infrastructure present in Podio. The task window however, is extended with the following functionality and data:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tasks can include subtasks. Subtasks are added to a task by pressing the "Add Subtask" button. When teams assign tasks to other teams, the receiving team may choose to define subtasks, that need to be completed before the assigned task can be completed. Subtasks can either be already existing tasks, or new tasks.
    \item Tasks include a "Done" description, in which the sender of the task may include a short description of when the task is considered to be done.
    \item Tasks are done when the receiving team presses the "Done" button under a task.
\end{itemize}
The data and functionality described above makes it possible to create a task map. The task map displays all active tasks in the system. A task is active if any of its subtasks are incomplete, or if it is itself a subtask to a task that is incomplete. Tasks are displayed graphically, with dependencies between them drawn as an directed arrow between them. Clicking a task will take the user to the task on Podio, where a detailed view of the task can be found. This solution will give arrangers an overview of deadlines, tasks associated with deadlines and dependencies between them across arranger teams.


\subsection{Technology}
\label{sub:technology}
The solution uses the built in functionality of Podio to build custom Podio apps to create the needed modifications to Podio tasks. The task map is drawn on a webpage outside of the Podio domain, using the Podio REST API.

\subsubsection{IT systems and IT platform}

The solution is primarily dependent on the existing Podio platform. It is necessary that Podio maintains the possibility of defining custom apps and accessing Podio data through the REST API.

\subsubsection{User interfaces}
On Podio, the interface is built using the existing Podio app builder tools. The task map is displayed by some Web UI technology. Tasks are shown as nodes, and dependencies between them are shown as directed arrows. Task completion status is indicated graphically by color. (ref til mock up)

\subsection{Work organisation}
\label{sub:work_organisation}
Arrangers and team leaders will have to change their work-flow with creating tasks, to comply with the format described in section \ref{visions_for_change}. An introduction to using the task map must also be designed.

\subsection{Qualification needs}
\label{sub:qualification_needs}
According to section \ref{sec:work_domains}, the team leaders are the people responsible of making
sure a team's task is done before the deadline is exceeded. The team leaders are also responsible
of an entire team of arrangers, which means that they meet with their team from time to time. This
makes the team leaders the most obvious and important user of all the functionalities of the new
system, thus making them the main users of the new system. 

The team leaders are the ones with the most experience in using Podio \ref{source}. Due to the above
the need of qualifications are most important to the team leaders. 

It is therefore important that the team leaders get the proper education regarding the new
application and its features. As described in section \ref{sub:technology}, the application is quite
simple and without too many complicated features. With this in mind, we believe that giving the team
leaders plus the four board members a full introduction, with an estimated duration of three hours,
and a manual to the application, should suffice to get the attendees to feel home in the use of the
application. We do also believe that the knowledge gained during this introduction, will make the
team leaders able to teach the rest of the team, how the application works.

\subsection{Advantages and disadvantages}
\label{sec:advantages_disadvantages}
In this section, we will provide an overview of the advantages and disadvantages of this particular
IT solution.
