As the previous sections of the \texttt{In-depth phase} in part \ref{prt:in_depth_analysis},
especially in section \ref{sub:goprne}, has shown,
the organisation has room for optimisation and improvements. Based on the \ref{sub:ideas} that we
have developed and the fact that the organisation wants to continue using Podio, we have chosen two that we believe will bring the most benefits to the organisation.
We will in the following analyse both the solutions, and try to determine which will be the best or
if a third solution will emerge from this analysis. A short description of the ideas in focus
follows:


1. Work processes for Podio\\
In the previous the Diagnostic Map in section revealed several problem and related causes found in the organization. In 5b its said that the cause of this problem, is that their is too much off topic discussion and also that no real difference between pure informational topics and topics for discussions are in place within the organizational use of Podio. As Stine F also points out in 1a, the organization faces a problem about sharing of knowledge, since this is not documented properly on Podio.\\

This solution proposal will attempt to structure work processes when using Podio and make guidelines for the information posted at Podio. This proposal will therefore be directed at the use of Podio, with respect to the mentioned things in the above, and will keep to the organizations our strategy about using Podio as their primary IT solution. 

2. Podio App
This solution consists of the development of a Podio application \footnote{https://developers.podio.com/doc/app-store}. 
The application will be used to create, store, and visualise tasks in- and externally in the teams.
Thus, hopefully, making it very transparent which tasks are due to when.
