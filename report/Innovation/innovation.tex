In 5b its said that the cause of this problem, is that their is too much off topic discussion and also that no real difference between pure informational topics and topics for discussions are in place within the organizational use of Podio.

This proposal will therefore be directed at the use of Podio, with respect to the mentioned things in the above, and will keep to the organizations our strategy about using Podio as their primary IT solution.
