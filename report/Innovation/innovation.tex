\part{Innovation}
As the previous sections in the \ref{prt:in_depth_analysis}, especially \ref{sub:goprne}, has shown,
the organisation has room for optimisation and improvements. Based on the \ref{sub:ideas} that we
have developed, we have chosen two that we believe will bring the most benefits to the organisation.
We will in the following analyse both the solutions, and try to determine which will be the best or
if a third solution will emerge from this analysis. A short description of the ideas in focus
follows:

1. Work processes for Podio

2. Podio App
