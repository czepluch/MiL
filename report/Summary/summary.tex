\part{Summary}

\section{About}
Musik i Lejet is a festival planned and executed by a group of volunteer arrangers. Over the last couple of years the festival has grown, and so has the workload and number of arrangers. In the current organizational setup, work domains are delegated to groups of arrangers. The groups must collaborate and coordinate their work, in areas where dependencies exist between them. If a task delegated to some group exceeds it deadline, it may cause a domino effect of postponing dependent tasks of other groups, thus affecting the entire organization. As the whole planning phase has a ultimo deadline each year, delayed tasks constitute a risk for the festival. The business case presented in the following aims to present an answer to the question:
