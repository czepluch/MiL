\section{Business and IT scope}
For this project the workgroup have chosen to focus on the managing part and more specific the board of Musik I lejet. We will also look at how the internal communication is shared between all members and what kind of work processes is in play when planning the festival. \\
Must of the communication is done at Musik i Lejet's Podio site and therefore we will direct our attention and observations towards that platform. Since this projects is done before the actual festival takes place, we will primarily focus on IT used before the festival, which to our belief, is only Podio.
